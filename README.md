KCoFI Pudding: The formal proofs for the KCoFI system

Introduction
============
This is the code for KCoFI Pudding: the formal semantics and control-flow
integrity proofs for the KCoFI system.  This is an enhanced version of the
code found in Appendix B of John Criswell's dissertation.  It includes
finished versions of the four primary CFI theorems from the original KCoFI
paper (Theorems cfisafe, NXText, Transcfisafe, and TranNXText).  Additionally,
it contains some proofs for the Virtual Ghost system (in VG.v) as well as
some incomplete theorems for proving a tighter control-flow integrity theorem
for KCoFI (namely Theorems cfisafe2 and Transcfisafe2).

The primary theorems are in SVAOS.v and Multi.v.

Build Instructions
==================

To build the proofs, you must have Coq 8.3pl5 installed (later versions may
work but haven't been tested).  To build the proofs (i.e., to mechanically
verify them with Coq), type "make."  The "-j" option can be used to
compile files in parallel.
